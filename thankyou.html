						The study in which you just participated was designed to measure the effects of self-control in athletes versus non-athletes, with an emphasis on endurance athletes. You were asked to complete a self-control survey to the best of your ability. Additionally, you were asked to complete a questionnaire that involved applications of self-control in other areas of your life such as procrastination and diet. We will be testing the effects of athletic participation on overall self-control ratings compared to the self-control ratings of non-athletes. Furthermore, we will test if self-control in athletes is implemented throughout various aspects of their life.

						Please do not discuss this study with other potential participants until the semester is over. If people know what we are testing before the study begins, they may respond differently, risking our results.
